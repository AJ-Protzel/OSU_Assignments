How I got the random numbers: 
I started n (length of array) at 5000 and did a while loop for 10 iterations by adding 5000 after each loop (while n < 50001 : includes the 10th 50000 array).

Within the while loop i created an array arr and made another while loop from 0 to n and appended randomint from 0 to 10000.

I then start time, sortedm then printed.

The arr is then reset and reused on the next n iteration.

Prediction / Comparison:
my formulas are:
   insertion => y=n^2/17000000
   merge => y=0.00001n
which when entering 20,000 I get
   insertion => 23.5294117647
   merge => 0.2
which are fairly close, which some fine tuning it would be better.
